heavy load, up to 140 pounds.

Mules are a domestic equine hybrid between a donkey and a horse.  Mules vary
widely in size, and may be of any color.  They are more patient, hardier and
longer-lived than horses, and are perceived as less obstinate and more
intelligent than donkeys.  Like donkeys, they are capable of being taken into
dungeons as pack animals.  A light load for a mule is up to 300 pounds; a heavy
load, up to 600 pounds.

A Pony is a variety of small horse. Compared to a larger horse, a pony may have
a thicker coat, mane and tail, with proportionally shorter legs, a wider
barrel, heavier bone, a thicker neck and a shorter, broader head.  Ponies can
be trained for war, and the morale in parentheses above is for a war pony; this
does not allow them to fight while a rider is mounted, however.  A light load
for a pony is up to 275 pounds; a heavy load, up to 550 pounds.
