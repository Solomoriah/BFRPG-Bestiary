# BFRPG-Bestiary

Project to provide Basic Fantasy RPG monsters in a machine-consumable format.

Please note that the repository at https://github.com/Solomoriah/BFRPG-Bestiary
is the canonical, official version of this package.

At the moment, the original data is being organized in files named
**Monster-Data-\*.txt**; the format of those files is based roughly on data copied
and pasted from the official Core Rules ODT file.  The converter.py script
reads those files and converts the data into JSON format in the file
**monster-data.json**.
