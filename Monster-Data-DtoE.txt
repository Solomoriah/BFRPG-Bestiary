Dryads are female nature spirits; each is mystically bound to a single, enormous oak tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it.  Any who do become ill and die within 4d6 hours.  A dryad's oak does not radiate magic.  A dryad lives as long as her tree, and dies when the tree dies; likewise, if the dryad is killed, her tree dies also.
A dryad resembles an elf woman, with skin like fine polished wood or smooth bark and hair like leaves; the hair color of a dryad usually changes with the seasons, being brown in the winter, pale green in the spring, darker green in the summer, and yellow, orange, or red in the fall.
Though they are usually content to live alone, dryads are often friends with creatures such as treant or other nature spirits who might live nearby.  Once per day a dryad can cast a charm similar to the spell charm person, and one may choose to use this ability to compel an interesting human or elf to remain with her as a companion for a period of up to a year.  The companion can be taken into and brought out of the dryad's tree so long as the charm is still in effect.

Eagles are large birds with wingspans 61/2 to 71/2 feet in width.  They stand about 21/2 to 3 feet tall and weigh about 13 lbs.  These birds have heavy talons and large beaks with a sharp hooked end.  Eagles are known to carry prey up to 15 lbs.  An eagle will also kill and start to eat animals that are 5 times the eagle's size, up to 80 lbs.  Fish-eating eagles are usually the largest varieties, while other types hunt small animals such as rodents or snakes.  Coloring is dependent on the species of eagle,  and should be chosen by the GM; various brown, gray, black, or white markings are most common, though solid darker colors are sometimes seen.  The beaks may range from bright yellowish orange to black.  Eagles will dive at a prey and attack with both sets of talons, then attack with the beak.

An average giant eagle has a wingspan of 15 to 20 feet and stands 8 to 12 feet tall.  They are intelligent creatures, and many speak Common or another language common in their home territory.
Individual giant eagles are rarely encountered alone, as they prefer to live in loose communities.  However, when they hunt they do so in a solitary fashion, with each eagle choosing a single creature as prey.  As they can communicate with each other, it is extremely rare for two of them to make the mistake of attacking the same prey; in fact, it is not uncommon for one to attack alone to scatter a group of prey so they can each more easily choose a victim.
Giant eagles mate for life.  If a nest with eggs or hatchlings is threatened, both parents will fight without checking morale, and other giant eagles in their community may come to their defense but will still seek to scatter any opponents so as to attack them one on one.

Efreet (singular efreeti) are a race of manlike creatures believed to be from the Elemental Plane of Fire.  They are large beings, 11 to 12 feet in height and weighing around 2,000 pounds, though their weight is generally immaterial due to their ability to fly by magical means.
Note that the 12 morale reflects an efreeti's absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily.  Use the "9" figure to determine whether an outmatched efreeti decides to leave a combat.
Efreet have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): become invisible, with unlimited uses per day; assume gaseous form, as the potion, up to one hour per day; create illusions, as the spell phantasmal force but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day; create flame, with unlimited uses; and create a wall of fire (as the spell), once per day.  Create flame allows the efreet to cause a flame to appear in its hand or otherwise on its person at will; it behaves as desired by the efreet, becoming as large as a torch flame or as small as a candle, and ignites flammable material just as any ordinary flame does.  The flame can be thrown as a weapon with a range of up to 60', causing 1d8 points of damage on a successful hit.  The efreet can create another flame, and throw it as well if desired, once per round.
Efreet may assume the form of a column of fire at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; an efreeti in flame-form fights as if it were a fire elemental.
Due to their highly magical nature, efreet cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.  They are immune to normal fire, and suffer only half damage from magical fire attacks.
