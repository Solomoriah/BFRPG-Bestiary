Elemental*
An elemental is a being formed from one of the foundational elements of reality.  In Western traditions, the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water; Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood.  This book presents the full range needed for either tradition, and to those types are added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish to be less traditional.  As always, the Game Master decides what sort of monsters appear in their world, and so not all of the following creatures may be encountered.
Each type of elemental may be summoned to the material plane by means of one of three different methods:
Conjured by the 5th level Magic-User spell conjure elemental; or,
Summoned by means of a magical staff; or,
Summoned by a device, as given in the Miscellaneous Magic subsection of the Treasure section of this book.
These three types of elementals are quite reasonably called staff, device, and conjured elementals.  The hit dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:

The summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it to control it, and may take no other action, including attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be lost.  Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the summoner and attack.
Elementals must be summoned from a large quantity of the appropriate natural material.  For example, air elementals require a large quantity of air (so small underground spaces will not support the summoning of one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work).  Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other elemental of the same type may be summoned in the same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.
Non-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental.  Attacks made by an elemental should be considered magical for purposes of determining how much damage creatures resistant to the elemental's attack form should suffer.
Generally, elementals are immune to both normal and magical forms of their own attack form.  Most are more susceptible to attacks from one or two specific other types of elemental; this is noted in the text for each type.
