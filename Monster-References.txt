Elemental*
An elemental is a being formed from one of the foundational elements of reality.  In Western traditions, the classical elements are air, earth, fire, and water; Asian traditions include a different group: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood.  This book presents the full range needed for either tradition, and to those types are added cold and lightning elementals for those who wish to be less traditional.  As always, the Game Master decides what sort of monsters appear in their world, and so not all of the following creatures may be encountered.
Each type of elemental may be summoned to the material plane by means of one of three different methods:
Conjured by the 5th level Magic-User spell conjure elemental; or,
Summoned by means of a magical staff; or,
Summoned by a device, as given in the Miscellaneous Magic subsection of the Treasure section of this book.
These three types of elementals are quite reasonably called staff, device, and conjured elementals.  The hit dice of an elemental depends on the type, as follows:
Type
Hit Dice
Staff
8
Device
12
Conjured
16
The summoner of an elemental must concentrate on it to control it, and may take no other action, including attacking, being attacked, or moving, or control will be lost.  Once control is lost it cannot be regained, and the uncontrolled elemental will move directly toward the summoner and attack.
Elementals must be summoned from a large quantity of the appropriate natural material.  For example, air elementals require a large quantity of air (so small underground spaces will not support the summoning of one); earth elementals require access to natural earth or stone (and worked stone such as the stone walls of a castle will not work); fire elementals require a large fire such as a bonfire; and water elementals require access to a substantial body of water, at the very least a river or lake (small streams and artificial pools will not work).  Finally, when an elemental is summoned, no other elemental of the same type may be summoned in the same day within a radius of 100 miles of the location.
Non-magical weapons cannot harm an elemental.  Attacks made by an elemental should be considered magical for purposes of determining how much damage creatures resistant to the elemental's attack form should suffer.
Generally, elementals are immune to both normal and magical forms of their own attack form.  Most are more susceptible to attacks from one or two specific other types of elemental; this is noted in the text for each type.

Golem*
Golems are a kind of construct, a creature created from non-living matter and animated by application of magic.  The powers required to animate a golem are prodigious, and involve summoning, capturing, and binding an elemental spirit to the constructed body.  This process also binds the golem to the will of its creator.
They are mindless, and thus immune to magics affecting the mind such as sleep, charm, hold, and any form of mind reading or telepathy.  They must be given explicit, detailed instructions verbally, and the controller must be within 60 feet of the golem to do so.  If not actively being commanded, a golem will follow the last instructions given to it until the controller returns.  If such a golem is attacked, it will fight in its own defense but will usually not pursue the attackers if they flee.  The controller can order the golem to follow the commands of another, but can always resume control if desired (i.e. the controller's commands always take precedence).
Employing a golem in combat is tricky, for once one attacks an opponent there is a cumulative 1% chance each round (so 1% the first round, 2% the second, 3% the third, and so on) that the golem will stop following commands and become berserk.  Once this happens the golem will attack any creature in range, choosing targets randomly when there are more than one.  If all targets are killed or driven away the golem will move on, looking for more creatures to kill and breaking down any barrier that stands in its way if it is at all possible.
The berserk chance for a golem that is still under control is reset to 0% only when the golem is inactive, neither attacking nor being attacked, for one full round.
The creator of the golem (but not any other person who might have been delegated control) may try to calm the golem, speaking firmly to it to convince it to stop.  The creator needs to succeed at a saving throw vs. Spells to do this, after spending a round talking to the golem.  If this roll fails the golem turns its attention to the creator and pursues them with single-minded hatred.
If a berserk golem is unable to attack anyone for 5 rounds it resumes its inactive state, and the controller can again give it commands.  If it begins to pursue its creator, though, it will never stop no matter how long it takes, and must normally be trapped or destroyed to stop it.  It has no special way to find the creator, however, and will become inactive if it loses sight of the creator for a minimum of 1 day.  If the golem is successfully calmed, it can be given commands again on the very next round of combat.
As their bodies are made of non-living matter, golems can only be hit by magical weapons.  Conversely, they are less resistant to various effects due to the fact that they are not living creatures; in general, golems save as if they were Fighters of 1/2 their hit dice in levels.  For example, a Bone Golem has 8 hit dice, but saves as a Fighter of 4th level.
