The sabre-tooth cat, or smilodon, is a prehistoric great cat with very large canine teeth.  They are more robustly built than other great cats, with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canine teeth.  Sabre-tooth cats are ambush predators, surprising on 1-4 on 1d6 in their natural environment (forests and tall-grass prairies), where they prey primarily upon large herbivores.

Flame salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Fire.  They look like giant snakes, more than 12' long, with dragon-like heads and lizard forelimbs.  Their scales are all the colors of flame, red and orange and yellow.  A flame salamander is flaming hot, and all non-fire-resistant creatures within 20' of the monster suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the heat.  They are immune to damage from any fire or heat attack.  Flame salamanders are intelligent; they speak the language of the Plane of Fire, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or Dragon.

Frost salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Water.  They look like giant lizards with six legs.  Their scales are the colors of ice, white, pale gray and pale blue.  Frost salamanders are very cold, and all non-cold-resistant creatures within 20' suffer 1d8 points of damage per round from the cold.  Frost salamanders are completely immune to all types of cold-based attacks.  They are quite intelligent; all speak the language of the Plane of Water, and many also speak Common, Elvish, and/or Dragon.
Flame and frost salamanders hate each other, and each type will attack the other on sight, in preference over any other foe.  If summoned by a Magic-User, a salamander is often assigned to protect a location, doorway, or treasure hoard; in such a case, the salamander will attack anyone attempting to gain unauthorized access to the protected area.  Those which arrive through natural rifts may have any goals or motivations the GM wishes, and thus may choose to parley, fight, or even ignore adventurers.

Lightning Salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Air.  A lightning salamander resembles a giant snake more than 12 feet long with two dragon-like heads (on short but flexible necks).  Its scales are all the colors of lightning: white, blue, purple, and yellow.  A lightning salamander constantly emits little bolts of lightning; all creatures within 20 feet of the salamander that are not lightning-resistant suffer 1d8 points of damage per round.  A lightning salamander is immune to damage from any type of electrical or lightning attack.  It is intelligent and can speak the language of the Plane of Air, and many will also know Elvish, Common, and/or Dragon.
Despite having two heads a lightning salamander has only one mind; either head may speak or both may, but it is very rare to meet a lightning salamander who can speak different words with each head at the same time (although those who can are known to sing duets with themselves, which may give away one's location to those listening).

Sand salamanders come from the Elemental Plane of Earth.  A sand salamander resembles a giant sea turtle with six flippers and a serpentine neck and head, with scales of varying shades of gray or brown.
The sand salamander's most feared attack is its bite, for any living creature bitten by one must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone.  In addition to attacking, a sand salamander can temporarily transform any stone within a 20 foot radius into sand.  Characters in the affected area must save vs. Paralysis each round in order to move through the sand, and if the save is successful, the character is still reduced to half their normal movement.  Whenever the sand salamander moves out of range, the sand "congeals" back into stone, and any character in the affected area must save vs. Paralysis or become trapped.  Extraction of a trapped person may take quite a long time, chipping and hammering at the stone to break it apart.
A sand salamander is immune to piercing attacks (such as spears or arrows) and suffers half damage from cutting attacks.  It is intelligent and can speak the language of the Plane of Earth; many may also know Elvish, Common, or Dragon.

A shadow is an incorporeal monster, literally a kind of living shadow.  Only magical weapons will harm one.  They have a generally humanoid shape and are around 5 to 6 feet in height, so that at a glance one might appear to be an actual shadow.  Indeed, it's hard to see one after nightfall, or in poorly-lit or unlit spaces indoors or underground; on the other hand, they are plainly visible in daylight or in well-lit places.
Despite their appearance they are not undead monsters and thus do not share those creatures' weaknesses or powers; however, they are immune to charm and sleep magics.
A shadow's attack does 1d4 points of cold damage and drains 1 point of Strength from the victim.  Victims reduced to 2 or fewer points of Strength collapse and become unable to move; those reduced to 0 Strength die and rise as shadows a day later (at nightfall).  Otherwise, Strength points lost to shadows are recovered at a rate of 1 point per turn.

A shrieker, sometimes called a wailing morel, is a large (3' to 5' tall and about the same size across), semi-mobile fungus that wails loudly as a defense mechanism when approached or threatened.  Shriekers are found in underground areas such as caverns and dungeons.  They are found in a variety of pale colors, most commonly white, gray, lavender, or red.
This monster does not attack directly; rather, its shrieking tends to attract the attention of other monsters in the nearby area.  Movement or light within 10 feet, or causing any damage to one, will cause one to wail for 1d4 rounds.
In game terms, the GM should generally roll a wandering monster check each round that this monster wails.

As with all undead, they can be Turned by a Cleric, and are immune to sleep, charm or hold magic. As they are mindless, no form of mind reading is of any use against them.  Skeletons never fail morale, and thus always fight until destroyed.

Pit vipers are highly venomous snakes.  There are many varieties ranging in size from 2' to 12' at adulthood; the statistics above are for an "average" variety which reaches about 9' in length.  Giant-sized pit vipers are much bigger, and range from 14' to 20' in length at adulthood.
Those bitten by a pit viper must save vs. Poison or die.
Pit vipers are named for the thermally sensitive "pits" between their eyes and nostrils.  These are used to detect birds, mammals, and lizards, the natural prey of these snakes.  Even though lizards are cold-blooded, pit vipers can still sense them because their temperature is often slightly higher or lower than their surroundings.
Rattlesnakes are a variety of pit viper; in addition to the details given above, a rattlesnake has a rattle (from which it gets its name) at the end of its tail.  The rattle is used to warn away larger creatures.

Sea snakes are relatively small; the largest varieties rarely exceed 6' in length.  They have relatively small heads, and are very stealthy in the water.  Their bite does so little damage that the creature bitten has only a 50% chance to notice the attack, but their poison is terribly strong, such that any creature bitten must save vs. Poison at a penalty of -4 or die.
Fortunately, sea snakes rarely attack; only if molested (grabbed, stepped on, etc.) will they do so.  They are very clumsy when out of the water.

Spitting cobras average about 7' in length at adulthood.  They use their spreading hood to warn other creatures not to bother them, and generally refrain from attacking if possible to allow larger creatures time to retreat.  Failure to retreat from the spitting cobra will likely result in the cobra spitting venom; the cobra can project its venom up to 5', and any living creature hit must roll a save vs. Poison or be blinded permanently (though the cure blindness spell can heal this injury).  If the cobra cannot deter a creature by spitting, it will attack using its bite.  In this case, those hit must save vs. Poison or die.

Spectres are incorporeal undead monsters.  On any successful hit against a living creature, a spectre drains two life energy levels in addition to doing normal damage.  Any character slain by a spectre will arise at the next sunset (but not sooner than 6 hours after death) as a spectre under the control of its killer.
A spectre will normally resemble the living creature it used to be.  Most spectres are formed from humanoid creatures, but some may have other forms and sizes; statistically, most such creatures will be as given above, but of course the GM may create special types.
Like all undead, they may be Turned by Clerics and are immune to sleep, charm, and hold magics.  Due to their incorporeal nature, they cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

Despite the size difference, both genders are statistically equal.  Both genders are marked with an orange "hourglass" on the abdomen.
The venom of the giant black widow is strong, such that those bitten must save vs. Poison at a penalty of -2 or die.  Giant black widow spiders spin strong, sticky, nearly invisible webs, usually across passageways or cave entrances, or sometimes between trees in the wilderness; those who stumble into these webs become stuck, and must roll to escape just as if opening a door.

Giant tarantulas are huge, hairy spiders, about the size of a pony.  They run down their prey much as wolves do.  The bite of the giant tarantula is poisonous; those bitten must save vs. Poison or be forced to dance wildly.  The dance lasts 2d10 rounds, during which time the victim has a -4 penalty on attack and saving throw rolls.  If the victim is a Thief, they cannot use any Thief abilities while dancing.  Onlookers must save vs. Spells or begin dancing themselves; such "secondary" victims suffer the same penalties as above, but they will only dance for 2d4 rounds.
Each round the original victim dances, they must save vs. Poison again or take 1d4 points of damage.  Secondary victims do not suffer this effect.  Neutralize poison will cure the original victim, and dispel magic will stop the dance for all victims in the area of effect, whether they are original or secondary.

The giant squid dwells in the deep ocean.  One can grow to a tremendous size, to a maximum of around 40 feet for females and 33 feet for males.  The mantle of the giant squid is about 61/2 feet long (more for females, less for males).  Their tentacles are studded with barbs and sharp-edged suckers.
Members of any group of these creatures encountered are equally likely to be male or female.  The GM may roll for this or may assign them as they see fit.
In order to bite a creature, the giant squid must hit with at least two tentacles first.  Further, any time a giant squid hits with at least one tentacle per each 75 pounds of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it; unless the victim can find a way to resist (using whatever method the player might think of and whatever rolls the GM may choose), they will be pulled into the water and thus be in danger of drowning.  Don't forget to account for the weight of armor worn!
If a giant squid fails a morale check, it will squirt out a cloud of black "ink" 30' in diameter and then jet away at twice normal speed for 3d8 rounds.  If a group fails a morale check they will move away in random directions in hopes that at least one will escape any pursuit.

Stirges are weird winged creatures that some say may have invaded from some other plane of existence.  They are relatively small, just about 1 foot long with a wingspan of about 2 feet and an average weight of 1 pound.  They vaguely resemble hairless bats with a rubbery tubular proboscis and no back legs (so that their body simply comes to a blunt point at the rear).
If a stirge hits a living creature, it grabs on with hooked claws on its wing joints and quickly embeds its proboscis in the victim's body.  The proboscis has rows of tiny serrated teeth on the inside, and literally turns itself inside out as it carves a way into the victim's body.  This causes 1d4 points of damage, and the stirge then proceeds to suck the victim's blood, inflicting an additional 1d4 points of damage each round.
Once attached, the creature can only be removed by killing it.  The victim cannot use weapons larger than a dagger or hand axe to attack the creature, and cannot attack it at all if attacked from behind.  Others may attack the creature with a bonus of +2 on the die roll, but any attack that misses hits the victim instead.

A strangle vine (sometimes called an assassin vine) is a strange animated plant found in temperate and tropical forests, particularly in areas with poor-quality soil.  They fertilize their soil by entangling, constricting, and killing living creatures, then depositing the bodies in loose soil around the plant's base.
Because it can lie very still indeed, a strangle vine surprises on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6.  A successful hit inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the victim becomes entangled, suffering an additional 1d8 points of damage thereafter.  A victim may attempt to escape by rolling a saving throw vs. Death Ray with Strength bonus added; this is a full action, so the victim may not attempt this and also perform an attack.  The plant will continue to crush its victim until one or the other is dead or the victim manages to escape.
Strangle vines are actually mobile, able to uproot themselves and move slowly from place to place; one  generally only does so to seek new hunting grounds.  They have no visual organs but can sense foes within 30 feet by sound and vibration.
Each plant consists of a single long vine of up to 20 feet in length, with many smaller vines 5 feet or so in length packed closely, two vines per foot or thereabouts.  The smaller vines are covered in leaves, and in the fall they bear clusters of reddish-purple berries which are tough and bitter but not poisonous.
There is a similar plant found in underground environments which has leaves the color of iron with pale shiny metallic veins.  They grow near geothermal vents or springs, and the rotting flesh that surrounds them often supports mushrooms of various sizes and types.  This fungal growth conceals the strangle vine, allowing it to surprise on 1-5 on 1d6 as does the above-ground variety of the plant.
