        "Cattle are large mammals with cloven hooves and horned heads.  Cattle are raised mostly for their meat (beef), leather, and milk.  Cattle eat grass and are fairly gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede (run in a group). Anyone caught in the path of the stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as determined by the GM.  Male cattle are called bulls, females are cows, and young are calves (calf is singular).  If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using their horns to attack.  Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure), and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd.  A bull will likely attack if he sees quick movements from creatures he might be able to reach with a charge.  Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a roughly circular formation with their heads outward, while calves will be kept in the center, though if the opponents are small enough they may instead charge en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.",
