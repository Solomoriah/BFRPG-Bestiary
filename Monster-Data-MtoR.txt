Mammoths are huge, shaggy prehistoric relatives of the elephant.  Though found in a variety of climates, they are most common in colder territories.
Like elephants, mammoths have five distinct attack modes (two tusks, a trunk grab, and two tramples with the front feet), but a single individual can apply no more than two of these attacks to any single opponent of small or medium size; large opponents may be targeted by three of these attacks in a round.  However, one can attack multiple opponents in its immediate area at the same time.
A light load for a mammoth is 8,500 pounds; a heavy load, up to 17,000 pounds.
A mammoth has no treasure as such, but its tusks are worth 2d6 x 100 gp.

Mastodons are a species related to mammoths, but found in more temperate climates.  These prehistoric relatives of the elephant are intelligent and able to communicate with each other in a rudimentary way.  They are more aggressive than the common elephant and will attack any creature they see as a threat.
They have the same basic attack modes as mammoths, with the same limitations as given above.
A light load for a mastodon is 8,000 pounds; a heavy load, up to 16,000 pounds.
A mastodon has no treasure as such, but its tusks are worth 1d10 x 100 gp.

Manticores look like an overgrown lion with thick leathery wings and an ugly bearded humanoid face, often like that of a human or dwarf.  Their tail ends in an assortment of spikes, which the beast may fire as projectiles; a maximum of 24 are available, and the manticore will launch a random number (1d8, as shown above) each time it chooses to use this attack.  The creature will regrow just 1d6 spikes per day after expending them, so they will often delay using them against weaker opponents who they think they can easily dispatch.
An adult manticore is big, with an average weight of 1,000 pounds and a length (not including tail) of around 8 feet.
Manticores are vicious carnivores with a preference for human flesh.  They will use their ranged attacks to "soften up" larger or more dangerous-looking prey before closing to melee range.

A medusa appears to be a human female with vipers growing from her head instead of hair.  The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it unless a save vs. Petrify is made.  In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its gaze.  Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC.  It is safe to view a medusa's reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC.  If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. Petrify itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise.  Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror she may see her reflection.
Further, the snakes growing from her head are poisonous (save vs. Poison or die in one turn).  They attack as a group, not individually, once per round for 1d6 points of damage (plus the poison).
These creatures are well aware that, from the neck down anyway, they are quite visually pleasing to most humanoid males; they will thus often seek to show off their bodies in clinging clothes while wearing veils, hoods, scarves, and so on to hide their true nature.  In this way they hope to get closer to potential victims and more easily surprise them.
Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the fact that, once the lair of one is found, any humans living nearby will not rest until she is slain.  They are hateful creatures, however, and will seek to destroy as many humans as they can without being discovered.

Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of dolphins.  Also called "sirens," mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or other men found near the sea.  They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.
A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards, but generally has no effect on women.  Men within the area of effect must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directly as possible.  If two mermaids are singing, apply a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit.  Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires.  When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain, depending on the mermaid's temperament.
Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor even half fish) and do not breathe water.  They can hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action.  However, being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes) causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.
Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normal human woman can produce up to the highest frequency of a dolphin.  This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% of mermaids will know the language of one or the other, and 10% can communicate with any such creature.
Three-quarters of mermaid births are female.  Of the quarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails.  Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted by humans, depending on the temperament of the mother.  Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservient to the females.  A small mermaid community (3d6 including the male) will often form around such a merman and his mother, who becomes their leader.  Such a group is called a pod.
A mermaid with a child will not generally be encountered, as they remain in the deeper parts of the ocean and avoid the attention of men.  Pods of mermaids do likewise, and in fact any pod includes 2d4-2 children or juveniles (over and above the number rolled for Number Appearing).  Adventurers generally meet mermaids only in groups of one or two.
Mermaids arm themselves with spears or daggers.  They hunt fish and harvest kelp for food.  Mermaids sometimes possess more than 1 hit die, and about 3% have some Clerical abilities.

Mummies are undead monsters, magically animated corpses wrapped in burial cloths.  They are normally man-sized, but due to their desiccation one will normally not weigh more than about 100 pounds.
As they are undead, mummies are immune to sleep, charm, and hold magic.  They can only be injured by spells, fire, or magical weapons; furthermore, magic weapons do only half damage, while any sort of fire-based attack does double damage.  Those injured by mummy attacks will contract mummy rot, a disease that prevents normal or magical healing; a cure disease spell must be applied to the victim before they may again regain hit points.

Nixies are small water fairies, just 4 feet tall and about 40 pounds at most.  As far as anyone knows, all nixies are female.  Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green skin and dark green hair.  They often twine shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed.
Ten or more nixies can work together to cast a powerful charm (similar to charm person).  The charm lasts one year (unless dispelled).  A save vs. Spells is allowed to resist.  Each nixie can cast water breathing once per day, with a duration of one day.  Finally, a group of nixies will often have a school of giant bass living nearby who can be called to their aid (see Fish, Giant Bass for details).
Nixies are fey creatures, and thus unpredictable.  However, they are rarely malicious, attacking only when they feel threatened.  They do not like leaving their safe, comfortable river or lake and will do so only in the most dire need.

The giant octopus is, obviously, an enormous version of the normal creature.  They are physically powerful as well as being clever, which makes them a serious threat to seagoing vessels.
In order to bite a creature, the giant octopus must hit with at least two tentacles first.  Further, any time a giant octopus hits with at least one tentacle per each 100 pounds of weight of its prey, it has grabbed it; unless the victim can find a way to resist (using whatever method the player might think of and whatever rolls the GM may choose), they will be pulled into the water and thus be in danger of drowning.  Don't forget to account for the weight of armor worn!
If a giant octopus fails a morale check, it will squirt out a cloud of black "ink" 40' in diameter and then jet away at twice normal speed for 2d6 rounds.  Any characters being held will normally be released at this point.

Orcs are short humanoids (around 5' tall) with solidly-built bodies.  Their upturned noses, wide pointed ears, and beady eyes give their faces a piglike appearance.  An adult weighs about 200 pounds, and this weight does not differ much between males and females. Orcs utilize all manner of weapons and armor scavenged from battlefields.
Orcs have Darkvision to a range of 60'.  They suffer an attack penalty of -1 in bright sunlight or within the radius of a spell causing magical light.  They speak their own rough and simple language, but many also speak some Common or Goblin.
One out of every eight orcs will be a warrior of 2 Hit Dice (75 XP).  Orcs gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior.  In orc lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) in chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11), a movement 20', and having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength.

Purple worms are gigantic subterranean monsters; they are rarely found above ground.  Adult purple worms range from 5-9 feet in diameter and 50-100 feet long, with an average weight of about 40,000 pounds.
The creature's tail ends in a narrow point tipped with a poisonous stinger; those injured by it must save vs. Poison or die.  Note that the purple worm's movement is less than the monster's length, so that, if attacking from out of a tunnel, it might not be able to use the stinger for several rounds.
Any time a purple worm successfully bites a man-sized or smaller opponent with a natural roll of 19 or 20, the opponent has been swallowed and will suffer 3d6 damage per round afterward due to being digested.  A character who has been swallowed can only effectively attack with small cutting or stabbing weapons such as dagger or shortsword.

Rats are omnivorous pests found in all climates where humans live.
Normal rats attack as a swarm; each point of damage done to the swarm reduces their numbers by one animal.
Giant rats are scavengers, but will attack to defend their nests and territories.  A giant rat can grow to be up to 4 feet long and weigh over 50 pounds.  A single giant rat, or a small group of up to four, will generally be shy, but larger packs attack fearlessly, biting and chewing with their sharp incisors.
Any rat bite has a 5% chance of causing a disease.  A character who suffers one or more rat bites where the die roll indicates disease will sicken in 3d6 hours. The infected character will lose one point of Constitution per hour; after losing each point, the character is allowed a save vs. Death Ray (adjusted by the current Constitution bonus or penalty) to break the fever and end the disease. Any character reduced to zero Constitution is dead. See Constitution Point Losses in the Encounter section for details on regaining lost Constitution.
* Note: The XP award for normal rats is for driving away or killing an entire pack of normal size.  If the adventurers are forced to flee, the GM should award 3 XP per rat slain.

The rhagodessa is related to both spiders and scorpions, though it is not properly either.  Rhagodessas have "pedipalps," an elongated pair of forelegs with sticky pads on them for capturing prey.
Giant rhagodessas are the size of a pony.  Those found in desert terrain are generally marked in yellow, red, and brown, while those found underground may be black or white in color (those found in the deepest caverns are always white).  Like spiders, they can climb walls, but they are unable to cross ceilings or otherwise climb entirely upside down.
A hit by a leg does no damage, but the victim is stuck fast and will be drawn to the rhagodessa's mouth on the next round and automatically hit for 2d8 points of damage; this repeats each round, so long as the victim is held.  Escaping from the sticky hold requires a successful roll to open doors.  If both legs hit, this roll frees the victim from just one of them; a second roll is needed to fully escape, and of course the rhagodessa can simply attack again with the free leg on the next round.  Alternately, victims may attack with small or medium melee weapons, and in fact gain a bonus of +2 to the attack roll if a small weapon is used.  If the giant rhagodessa is slain, any held victim can be freed with the open doors roll mentioned above (and in this case another character can help, making the roll for the victim).
The rhagodessa seems unable to use its bite attack against a foe it has not captured in this way, and neither will it attack more than one foe with its legs.  If threatened, a rhagodessa which has captured a victim will attempt to withdraw to consume its prey in peace.

Rocs are birds similar to eagles, but even a "normal" roc is huge, being about 9 feet long and having a wingspan of 24 feet.  Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet.  A roc's plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail.  Like most birds, the males have the brighter plumage, with females being duller in color and thus more easily hidden (if anything so large can even be hidden, that is).
A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load is 300 pounds.  Obviously only the smallest characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc.  For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1,200.  Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3,000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to 6,000 pounds.  Tales of giant rocs carrying off full-grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds.
A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour.  Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the roc to carry.  While being carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to be as "fresh" as possible when given to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary).
When rocs are encountered they are almost certainly hunting, and will generally attack creatures of horse size or less.  If facing a large group the rocs may make passes close overhead to scatter them first before each chooses a single target to prey upon.  Mated pairs found in their nests will fight to the death to protect their eggs or offspring (morale of 12 in this case).

Rock baboons are a large, particularly intelligent variety of baboon.  An adult male rock baboon is 4' to 5' tall and weighs 200 to 250 pounds, with females being a bit smaller and lighter.
Rock baboons are omnivorous, but prefer meat.  They are aggressive, naturally cruel creatures.  They will prepare ambushes in rocky or forested terrain and attack any party they outnumber.

Rot grubs are 1-inch long vermin found in carrion, dung, and other such garbage and organic material.  Their skin color is white or brown.  When a living creature contacts an area (dung heap, offal, etc) infested with rot grubs, the grubs will attack if they can come in contact with the victim's skin.  A rot grub secretes an anesthetic when it bites and will burrow into the flesh.  A burrowing grub can be noticed if the victim makes a successful save vs. Death Ray with Wisdom bonus applied in order to notice a strange rippling beneath their skin.  Otherwise, the victim does not notice the grubs.  During the first two rounds, a burrowing rot grub can be killed by applying fire to the infested skin or by cutting open the infested skin with any slashing weapon.  Either method deals 1d8 points of damage to the victim, but kills the grubs.  After the second round, only cure disease can kill the grubs before they burrow to the victim's heart and devour it in 1d3 turns.

A rust monster (sometimes known as a corroder or corrosion beast) is a strange monster built like a huge turtle, with an insectoid head sporting large feather-like antennae and a thick tail with a hammer-like protrusion at the tip which seems to serve no purpose whatsoever.
The touch of any part of a rust monster's body oxidizes metal objects instantly, turning them to rust, verdigris, or other oxides as appropriate.  One attacks with its antennae, brushing them over metal items.  Non-magical metal attacked by a rust monster, or that touches the monster (such as a sword used to attack it), is instantly ruined.  A hit with a non-magical metal weapon inflicts half damage before the weapon is destroyed.  Magic weapons or armor permanently lose one "plus" each time they make contact with the monster.
The metal oxides created by this monster are its food; a substantial amount of metal dropped in its path may cause it to cease pursuit of metal-armored characters.  Use a morale check to determine this.  Metals that do not normally oxidize, such as gold, are of no interest to a rust monster and will be ignored.  While rust monsters will consume oxides of silver or copper, they have a strong preference for ferrous metals (iron or steel), preferring them over any other metal.
Whether the rust monster is in any way related to the rarer ironbane (as found on page 93) is unknown, but both monsters seem to have the exact same power.
