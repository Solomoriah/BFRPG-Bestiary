Giant ants are fantastically enlarged versions of the more common variety of ants.  Normal workers are 5 to 6 feet long; queens are larger, growing up to 9 feet in length.  Giant ants may be red or black; there is no statistical difference between them.  Though relatively shy when first encountered, once combat begins they will fight to the death.  They are known to collect shiny things, and so will sometimes have a small amount of treasure in their lair.
Giant ants may occasionally mine shiny metals such as gold or silver; one in three (1-2 on 1d6) giant ant lairs will contain 1d100 x 1d100 gp value in relatively pure nuggets.

Barklings are diminutive furry humanoids with very dog-like faces.  They stand between 21/2 and 31/2 feet tall and typically weigh around 45 pounds.  They are pack hunters by nature, shy when encountered singly or in small groups but bold when their numbers are overwhelming.  Use the higher morale figure when a barkling group outnumbers their enemies by 3 combatants to 1 or more.
Barklings can deliver a nasty bite but prefer to fight with weapons, favoring small weapons made for their stature and relative lack of strength; all such weapons do 1d4 points of damage on a hit.
Barklings see well in the dark, having Darkvision with a range of 30 feet, but their sense of smell is where they excel; a barkling can track almost any living or corporeal undead creature by scent, even if it has been as much as a day since it passed.
In combat barklings usually wear chainmail armor which they craft themselves (as shown in the Armor Class given above).
One out of every ten barklings will be a warrior with 1 hit die (25 XP).  In barkling encampments, one out of every twenty will be a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength.  In villages of 50 or more there will be a barkling lord of 3 hit dice (145 XP) who has +1 bonus to damage.  Barklings gain a +1 bonus to their morale as long as they are led by any of their leaders.
In addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a wizard being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a chieftain is present).  A wizard is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior barkling statistically, but has Magic-User abilities at level 1d4+1.  For XP purposes, treat the wizard barkling as if it has a number of hit dice equal to its magic-user level -1, and assign one special ability bonus asterisk.
Barklings are sometimes confused with kobolds, for whom they have a particular hatred; calling a barkling a kobold or suggesting that the two species are related is considered a terrible insult.

A basilisk is a giant six-legged lizard-like monster that petrifies living creatures with its gaze.  A basilisk has dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale yellow or white belly.  Adults reach a body length of 5 to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a weight of 250 to 400 pounds.  There is no particular difference in size between males and females.
Any living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone instantly.  In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze.  Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC.  It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC.  If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify.  Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror it may see its reflection.

The greater basilisk appears identical to the common variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of about 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighing between 400 and 750 pounds.  The skin of the greater basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare skin must save vs. Poison or die.  This effect persists even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20 hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea.

Giant bombardier beetles have red head and thorax sections and black abdomens.  They are 3 to 4 feet long.  In combat, a giant bombardier beetle bites opponents in front of it, and sprays a cone of very hot and noxious gases from a nozzle in the rearmost tip of the abdomen.  This toxic blast causes 2d6 points of damage to all within a cone 10' long and 10' wide at the far end (a save vs. Death Ray for half damage is allowed).  A giant bombardier beetle can use this spray attack up to five times per day, but no more than once per three rounds.  Faced with enemies attacking from one direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to turn away and use the spray attack rather than biting.
Giant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have about the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.

Blink dogs, also known as flicker beasts, are strange creatures which resemble wolves or hyenas who can teleport up to 120 feet at will.  Teleportation is so easy for them that they can sometimes teleport away before being attacked.  When one knows of the attacker's action (i.e. can see or possibly hear the attack about to happen) it is allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray, and on a successful roll it teleports 1d6 x 10 feet in a random direction (but never into solid matter, nor into any dangerous area the creature knows about).
These creatures are pack hunters, using their teleportation to confuse their prey until they are able to surround it.  In this way, some members of the pack will be able to attack from behind, a trick they are so good at that they receive the same benefits as a thief: +4 to hit and double damage if the hit is successful.
Blink dogs are large canines, typically light brown in color with short bristly hair; some varieties are striped or spotted.  They communicate using a language of barks, growls, and yips which is somewhat limited but can convey useful tactical information.  They are shy, generally avoiding a fight if possible, but they hate deceivers and will generally attack them on sight.

Blood roses appear to be normal rose bushes, but are actually animated plants, dimly aware of their surroundings.  These plants are always in bloom, bearing beautiful flowers that are normally white (or rarely, yellow) in color.
The fragrance of the flowers is detectable up to 30' from the plant in ideal conditions.  Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions.  Living creatures who smell the fragrance must save vs. Poison or become befuddled; such a victim will drop anything carried and try to approach the plant.  Each round an unaffected living creature can smell the fragrance it must make this save.  Befuddled creatures will not resist the attacks of the blood rose; if affected creatures are removed from the area, the effect of the fragrance will expire 2d4 rounds later.  Undead monsters, constructs, etc. are not affected.
Each blood rose plant will have 1, 2 or 3 whiplike canes studded with thorns with which it can attack.  When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round.  A blood rose which has recently (within one day) "eaten" in this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in color, which will fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed.

Bugbear attacks are coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant.  They are able to move in nearly complete silence, surprising opponents on 1-3 on 1d6.  In order to remain silent, they must wear only leather or hide armor, as indicated in the Armor Class scores above.  Bugbears receive a +1 bonus on damage due to their great Strength.  As with most goblinoid monsters, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.
One out of every eight bugbears will be a hardened warrior of 4+4 Hit Dice (240 XP), with a +2 bonus to damage.

Caecilia are carnivorous, legless amphibians; they strongly resemble earthworms, but they have bony skeletons and sharp teeth.  Caecilia live entirely underground.  The giant variety can grow up to 30' long and frequently are found in caverns or dungeons.  They are nearly blind, but caecilia are very sensitive to sound and vibrations, and are able to find their prey regardless of light or the absence thereof.
A giant caecilia can swallow a single small humanoid (such as a goblin or halfling) whole.  On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, such a victim has been swallowed (assuming that roll does actually hit the victim).  A swallowed victim suffers 1d8 damage per round, and may only attack from the inside with a small cutting or stabbing weapon such as a dagger.  While the inside of the caecilia is easier for the victim to hit, fighting while swallowed is more difficult, so no modifiers to the attack roll are applied.
Once a caecilia has swallowed an opponent, it will generally attempt to disengage from combat, going to its lair to rest and digest its meal.

Cattle are large mammals with cloven hooves and horned heads.  Cattle are raised mostly for their meat (beef), leather, and milk.  Cattle eat grass and are fairly gentle unless spooked, in which case they will stampede (run in a group). Anyone caught in the path of the stampede will suffer at least one trampling attack, as determined by the GM.  Male cattle are called bulls, females are cows, and young are calves (calf is singular).  If attacked, cattle will charge, generally using their horns to attack.  Bulls are larger (+1 hit die), less easily frightened (use the second listed morale figure), and are quite aggressive in defense of the herd.  A bull will likely attack if he sees quick movements from creatures he might be able to reach with a charge.  Meanwhile, if unable to flee cows will usually assume a roughly circular formation with their heads outward, while calves will be kept in the center, though if the opponents are small enough they may instead charge en masse, trampling all creatures in their path.
A typical small farm with cattle will have a bull, 5d4 cows, and 2d10 calves (but not more than the number of cows).
An ox is typically a castrated bull used as a draft animal; females may be used, rarely, but males are preferred due to their greater size and strength.  Oxen are usually paired as a team to pull a fully-loaded wagon (or the equivalent of 3,000 lb).  Oxen require less food and water, being able to eat rough grass better than draft horses, which makes them valuable to merchants with large caravans going over semi-arid prairie.

Giant cave locusts are pale, cricket-like creatures that live underground.  An average giant cave locust is 2 to 4 feet long.  They are eyeless, depending on their sound-sensitive antennae, vibration-sensitive feet and a variety of touch-sensitive "hairs" on their legs to sense the environment around them.
These creatures eat subterranean fungus (including shriekers) as well as carrion; they are not predators, but if disturbed they will attack, shrieking loudly, biting, jumping wildly around, or spitting nasty goo.
All giant cave locusts in a group will shriek when disturbed, attracting wandering monsters.  The GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that one or more cave locusts are attacking; if wandering monsters are indicated, they will arrive in 1d4 rounds.
Any giant cave locust that is engaged (adjacent to an opponent) will attempt to bite, doing 1d2 damage on a successful hit.  This does not interrupt the monster's shrieking.
A giant cave locust can leap up to 60' horizontally, or up to 30' up.  If one of these creatures is not engaged at the beginning of the round, it will leap toward one of the opponent creatures; roll a normal attack roll, and if the attack hits, the target creature takes 1d4 points of non-lethal damage from the impact.
Finally, a giant cave locust can spray a greenish-brown goo (its digestive juices) up to 10' away.  Each giant cave locust can perform this attack just once per encounter.  This spit attack will usually be reserved until they fail a morale check, in which case all remaining giant cave locusts will spit at their nearest opponent, and then all will attempt to flee in the next round.  To spit on an opponent, the giant cave locust rolls an attack against Armor Class 11 (plus Dexterity and magical bonuses, but no normal armor value applies).  If the attack hits, the target must save vs. Poison or be unable to do anything for 3d6 rounds due to the horrible smell.

Centaurs appear to be half man, half horse, having the torso, arms and head of a man in the position a horse's head would otherwise occupy.  The horse part of a centaur is as large and powerful as a warhorse; males average 7 feet in height and weigh about a ton (2,000 pounds), while females are just a bit shorter and very close to the same weight.  Centaurs may charge with a spear or lance just as a man on horseback, with the same bonuses.  They typically wear leather armor when prepared for combat.
Centaurs are generally haughty and aloof, but very honorable.  Most would rather die than allow any sort of humanoid to ride on their backs.

Giant centipedes are larger versions of the normal sort, being 2 to 3 feet long.  Centipedes are fast-moving, predatory, venomous arthropods, having long segmented bodies with exoskeletons.  They prefer to live in underground areas, shadowy forested areas, and other places out of direct sunlight; however, there are desert-dwelling varieties that hide under the sand waiting for prey to wander by.
These creatures are aggressive and always hungry, attacking any living creature and only checking morale if injured.  Giant centipedes attack with a poisonous bite, and those bitten must save vs. Poison or die; however, the poison is somewhat weak and thus grants a bonus of +2 on the saving throw.

Chimeras are strange creatures having a lion's body with the heads of a lion, a goat, and a dragon, and the wings of a dragon.  The dragon head of a chimera could be any common dragon except cloud (i.e. desert, forest, ice, mountain, plains, or sea), and has the same type of breath weapon as that sort of dragon.  Regardless of type, the dragon's head breathes a 50' long cone with a 10' wide end which inflicts 3d6 points of damage; victims may save vs. Dragon Breath for one-half damage.
Chimeras are cruel and voracious.  They can speak Dragon but seldom bother to do so, except when toadying to more powerful creatures.

A cockatrice is a strange creature, appearing to be a chicken (hen or rooster) with a long serpentine neck and tail; the neck is topped by a more or less normal looking chicken head.  Like a common rooster, a male cockatrice has wattles and a full comb, while the much rarer females have neither.  An individual cockatrice weighs more than a chicken, averaging about 20 pounds.  A cockatrice is no more intelligent than any animal, but they are bad-tempered and prone to attack if disturbed.
Anyone touched by a cockatrice, or who touches one (even if gloved), must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone.

Giant crabs naturally resemble the ordinary variety, but are much larger, averaging 5' in diameter (not counting their legs).  These creatures are often found in water-filled caves, particularly those connected to a river, lake or sea, and are tolerant of both fresh and salt water.  Also, they are able to live in stagnant water, though they prefer a better environment.
Giant crabs carry their eyes on armored stalks, which means that no bonus is awarded for attacking them from behind.

Deceivers are greenish-black catlike monsters with thick serpents extending from their shoulders.  All three of the monster's mouths can bite, though the smaller serpent heads do not do as much damage.
The real power and danger of the deceiver is its power of deception, a mental ability which causes those attacking the monster to believe the creature is about 3 feet from its true location.  Any character fighting a deceiver for the first time will miss their first strike regardless of the die roll.  Thereafter, all attacks against deceivers will be at a penalty of -2 to the attack roll.  This is not cumulative with the penalty for fighting blind.  As a mental power, this ability does not affect mindless creatures, constructs such as golems or living statues, or any sort of undead.  Living creatures which are not mindless will be affected even if they do not use sight to target the deceiver.

A triceratops is a three-horned herbivorous dinosaur.  They are aggressive toward interlopers, attacking anyone who might appear to be a threat.  Individuals are quite large, weighing 11,000 to 20,000 pounds and ranging from 26 to 30 feet in length.
When facing opponents of smaller size, a triceratops will usually attempt to trample them, reserving the gore attack for larger opponents.  Up to two adjacent man-sized or up to four smaller opponents may be trampled simultaneously; the triceratops rolls a single attack roll which is compared to the Armor Class of each of the potential victims, and then rolls a separate damage roll for each one successfully hit.  The gore attack may only be used against a single man-sized or larger creature, but may be used in the same round as the trample if the creature being gored is larger than man sized.  Also note that a charging bonus may be applied to the gore attack.

The tyrannosaurus rex is a bipedal carnivorous dinosaur with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, its forelimbs are short but unusually powerful for their size, with two clawed digits.  Despite this, they are not used to attack, as the tyrannosaur's powerful bite is its preferred weapon.
Individuals can grow to lengths of over 40 feet and can weigh up to 20,000 pounds, though most are a bit smaller than this, averaging around 35 feet in length and 17,000 pounds in weight.
The statistics above can also be used to represent other large bipedal carnosaurs, such as the allosaurus.

Djinn (singular djinni) are a race of manlike creatures believed to be from the Elemental Plane of Air.  They are large beings, 10 to 11 feet in height and weighing around 1,000 pounds, though their weight is generally immaterial due to their ability to fly by magical means.
The djinni's morale score of 12 reflects its absolute control over its own fear, but does not indicate that the creature will throw its life away easily.  Use the "8" figure to determine whether an outmatched djinni decides to leave a combat.
Djinn have a number of magical powers, which can be used at will (that is, without needing magic words or gestures): create food and drink, creating tasty and nourishing food for up to 2d6 humans or similar creatures, once per day; become invisible, with unlimited uses per day; create normal items, creating up to 1,000 pounds of soft goods or wooden items of permanent nature or metal goods lasting at most a day, once per day; assume gaseous form, as the potion, up to one hour per day; and create illusions, as the spell phantasmal force but including sound as well as visual elements, three times per day.
Djinn may assume the form of a whirlwind at will, with no limit as to the number of times per day this power may be used; a djinni in whirlwind form fights as if it were an air elemental.
Due to their highly magical nature, djinn cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.  They are immune to normal cold, and suffer only half damage from magical attacks based on either cold or wind.

Dopplegangers are weird humanoid creatures who are able to take on the appearance of nearly any other humanoid ranging from 3 feet up to 7 feet in height.  They can also read minds (as the spell, mind reading, but with unlimited duration), an ability that can even be used to speak any language known to the creature whose mind is being read.  In their natural form (which few creatures ever see) they are pale and pasty looking, slim, around 51/2 feet tall and weighing about 150 pounds.  Their features look unformed and incomplete.
Dopplegangers wish to live a life of ease, and in pursuit of that goal they will seek to take the place of any character they meet who they believe can help them get that kind of life.  This usually means separating the victim from any allies and quietly killing them.  While a doppleganger can duplicate the appearance of the clothing and equipment worn by a creature, such items are part of the creature and cannot, for example, be laid down or handed to someone.  Taking the clothing and equipment of a victim is thus the preferred tactic.
A doppleganger can mimic the sound of the voice of any living creature as well as the appearance of any humanoid.  Their mind reading ability will be used to help them behave like the person they have replaced.
